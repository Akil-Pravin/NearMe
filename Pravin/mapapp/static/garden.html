    One of the most famous parks in Madurai is the **Rajaji Park**, located near the Madurai Corporation office and the Meenakshi Amman Temple. It is a popular recreational spot for both locals and tourists, offering a peaceful environment with lush green trees, flower gardens, and walking paths. The park is named after **C. Rajagopalachari**, India’s first Governor-General, and serves as a great place for families and children to relax and enjoy outdoor activities. With its fountains, play areas, and shaded benches, Rajaji Park provides a refreshing escape from the city’s busy life and adds to Madurai’s charm and beauty.
