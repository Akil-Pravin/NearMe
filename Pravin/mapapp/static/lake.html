Madurai is home to several beautiful lakes that play an important role in maintaining the cityâ€™s ecosystem and water supply. Among them, the **Vandiyur Mariamman Teppakulam** is the most famous lake in Madurai. It is a large man-made tank located near the Vandiyur Mariamman Temple and is known for its scenic beauty and historical significance. The tank is famous for the **Teppam Festival (Float Festival)**, during which the idols of Goddess Meenakshi and Lord Sundareswarar are taken around the lake on a beautifully decorated float. Surrounded by steps and greenery, the lake not only serves religious and cultural purposes but also adds to the charm and heritage of Madurai.
