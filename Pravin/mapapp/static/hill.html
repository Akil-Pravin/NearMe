    Yanaimalai Hills, located on the outskirts of Madurai in Tamil Nadu, is a sacred and historical site known for its ancient rock-cut Jain and Hindu sculptures. The name “Yanaimalai” means “Elephant Hill,” as the hill resembles a seated elephant. It holds great archaeological and religious significance, featuring ancient caves, inscriptions, and temples dedicated to Lord Vishnu and Jain Tirthankaras. The hill also contains the Narasingam Yoga Narasimha Temple, a famous rock-cut shrine. Surrounded by natural beauty and spirituality, Yanaimalai stands as a symbol of Tamil heritage, faith, and ancient craftsmanship.
